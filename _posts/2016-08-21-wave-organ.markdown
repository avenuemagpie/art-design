title:  "The Wave Organ"
date:   2016-08-21
summary: In which I realize how much I identify with an unassuming art piece despite the fact I can’t take a selfie with it. Not really no. Well I could try by getting the Golden Gate Bridge or the Palace of Fine Arts in the background, or maybe take a photo of myself setting my ear against one of the PVC pipe openings, my fingers set in a peace sign. That might work.

The sculpture is located in the Marina neighborhood in San Francisco. It can be found in between Crissy Fields and Fort Mason, off the eastern far end of the Golden Gate Yacht Club. It’s a very unassuming, very gray and obscure art piece made by [a former Senior Artist in Residence from the Exploratorium](http://www.exploratorium.edu/visit/wave-organ). [Peter Richards pulled together the help of acoustic engineers and a mason](https://www.olats.org/studiolab/Peter_Richards.pdf). He combined a natural input (tidal waves), stones from the former Laurel Hill Cemetery and PVC pipes to create a contemplative [acoustic sculpture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_Organ). Made the year I was born, the "organ" gets you to listen to the music of the tidal waves. Best heard at high tides, it’s a great idea, one that is in interesting contrast with the work done by [Soundwave](http://soundwavesf.com/7/material-notation/). The former art pieces magnifies the natural sounds of things that have been and always will be and the latter piece creates melodies that reflect and extoll man made creations.


Personally, Past and Present

I cannot deny the quiet power behind experiencing the flow of water. It is an amazing thing, that while I am so physically motionless I am still so very much alive, listening the moving waters. I tried to identify why it was so powerful. Perhaps the clarity of the information source, minimally processed, unaltered, true to form, something rarely found in urban jungles is what draws me in conceptually too. I have heard water flowing from artifically created streams, but it's just not the same thing. Clean water renews, heals, calms. Flowing water lulls minds into meditative thoughts. What does one do with an element that threatens to pull you into the depths of the San Francisco Bay? Nothing but to approach the element with confidence. I can be still, but I can also observe and be aware and become familiar with the tidal waves. Evaluate the water and then with some courage, create something wonderful.

Now What?

I'm not sure. I've visited [Halprin’s lagoon and streams](http://experiments.californiahistoricalsociety.org/lawrence-halprin-and-the-letterman-digital-arts-center/), or Crissy field’s nature preserve / beaches for similar experiences. Better yet, I would love visit and meditate in the still steam pools of Iceland that’s being touted all over social media. Ultimately, I'd love to make and share a piece of art with either an man-made or natural inputs.
