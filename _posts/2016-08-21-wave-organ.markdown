There is a sculpture located in the Marina neighborhood in San Francisco. It can be found in between Crissy Fields and Fort Mason, off the eastern far end of the Golden Gate Yacht Club.

It’s a very unassuming, very gray and obscure art piece made by [a former Senior Artist in Residence from the Exploratorium](http://www.exploratorium.edu/visit/wave-organ). [Peter Richards consulted with acoustic engineers and a mason](https://www.olats.org/studiolab/Peter_Richards.pdf). He brought together natural input from tidal waves, stones from the former Laurel Hill Cemetery and PVC pipes to create a contemplative [acoustic sculpture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_Organ). Made the year I was born, the "organ" gets you to listen to the music of the tidal waves. Best heard at high tides, it’s a great idea especially when held in contrast with the work done by [Soundwave](http://soundwavesf.com/7/material-notation/). The former art pieces magnifies the natural sounds of things that have been and always will be and the latter creates melodies that reflect and extoll man-made creations.


Past and Present
---

There is a quiet power behind experiencing the flow of water. How amazing it is that despite my being physically motionless, listening to the moving waters I feel very much alive. I tried to identify why it was so powerful. Perhaps the clarity of the information source, minimally processed, unaltered, true to form, something rarely found in urban life is what draws me in conceptually. I have heard water flowing from artifically created streams, but it's just not the same thing. Clean water renews, heals, calms. Flowing water lulls minds into meditative thoughts. What does one do with an element that threatens to pull you into the depths of the San Francisco Bay? Nothing but to approach the element with confidence. I can be still, but I can also observe and be aware and become familiar with the tidal waves. Evaluate the water and then with some courage, create something wonderful.

Now What?

I'm not sure. I've visited [Halprin’s lagoon and streams](http://experiments.californiahistoricalsociety.org/lawrence-halprin-and-the-letterman-digital-arts-center/), or Crissy field’s nature preserve / beaches for similar experiences. Better yet, I would love to visit and meditate in the still steam pools of Iceland that’s being touted all over social media. Perhaps I'd love to make and share a piece of art that uses either man-made or natural inputs. Thoughts on this anyone?
