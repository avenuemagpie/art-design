summary: In which I realize how much I identify with an unassuming art piece despite the fact I can’t take a selfie with it. Not really no. Well you could try by getting the Golden Gate Bridge or the Palace of Fine Arts in the background, or maybe take a photo of you setting your ear against one of the PVC pipe openings. That might work.

The Art Piece
---

The sculpture is located in the Marina in between Crissy Fields and Fort Mason off the far end of the Golden Gate Yacht Club. It’s a very unassuming, very gray and obscure art piece made by a Senior Artist in Residence from the Exploratorium. It might be puzzle as to where the art piece is once you get there. [Peter Richards pulled together the help of acoustic engineers and a mason](https://www.olats.org/studiolab/Peter_Richards.pdf) to take a natural input (tidal waves), stones from the former Laurel Hill Cemetery and PVC pipes to create a contemplative [acoustic sculpture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_Organ). This wave organ gets you to listen to tidal wave music. It’s a great idea, one that contrasts interestingly with the work done by [Soundwave, music made and inspired from collectively civilized man made things](http://soundwavesf.com/7/material-notation/). The former art pieces magnifies the natural sounds of things that have been and always will be and the latter piece extolls through sound man made creations.


Personally, Past and Present

There is something powerful about experiencing the flow of water. You are completely motionless but still very much alive, listening. Artificially created flows of water cannot compare to water heard out in nature. I tried to identify why it was so powerful. Memories of my dad telling me about how clean and refreshing the waters of Cambodia came up. Perhaps that was why? Perhaps the clarity of the information source, minimally processed, unaltered, true to form, something rarely found in urban jungles is what draws me in conceptually too. Clean water renews, heals, calms. Flowing water lulls minds into meditative thoughts. What does one do with an element that threatens to pull you into the depths of the San Francisco Bay? Nothing but to approach the element with confidence. You can be still, but you can also observe and be aware and become familiar with the tidal waves. Evaluate the water and then create something wonderful.

Now What?

Go visit Halprin’s pond, or Crissy field’s nature preserve / beaches for a similar experience. Better yet, visit and meditate in the still steam pools of Iceland that’s being touted all over social media. Make a piece of art with either an artificial or natural input to share.
