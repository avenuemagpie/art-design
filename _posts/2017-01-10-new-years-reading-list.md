## Some books I'm starting off the new year include:

* Understanding your users by Kathy Baxter (for DESIGN X475.3 - 001  User Research)
* Designing your life by Bill Bernett & Dave Evans
* Visual Explantions by Edwarde Tufte
* Designing Connected Products by Claire Rowland, Elizabeth Goodman, Martin Charlier, Ann Light & Alfred Lui

I'll publish my notes here as I finish each book.
