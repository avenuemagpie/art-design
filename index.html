	<h1>Places in the Bay Area that Drive the Concept of STEAM</h1>
		
	<p>I know my daughter is her own person. I still aim to share with her what I know of augmented realities, of internet of things and of useful smart devices. She can see this world that will engage her mind to appreciate a particular aesthetic, will help map spatial dimensions to her mind, and emphasizes learning by doing. To make and to shape something with your hands brings a special joy and growth of mind. I keep an eye out for activities to nurture her confidence. I find structures to give her a scaffold to tackle and appreciate the beautiful, complex realities that make up life and living. </p>

	<p>There are a couple places in the San Francisco Bay Area that I think helps to achieve this. </p>

	<ul>
	<li>Children's Creativity Museum</li>
	<li>CuriOdyssey</li>
	<li>Randall Museum</li>
	<li>Chabot Space and Science Center</li>
	<li>Bay Area Discovery Museum</li>
	<li>Tech Museum of Innovation</li>
	<li>Lawrence Hall of Science</li>
	<li>The Exploratorium</li>
	<li>Local Library programs</li>
	<li>At Home</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>What experiences do you think provides momentum into STEAM for you and your loved ones? </p>

	<h1>A Note from the Avenue Magpie</h1>
	<p>Avenue Magpie projects reflect my experiences of design and culture while living in San Francisco.</p>

	<p>I use techniques and materials to make my world more beautiful. When I can I bring my daughter in through complementary play. </p>

	<p>My goal? Make spaces for joy through the practice of art and empathy.  </p>

	<p>Thanks for reading.</p>
