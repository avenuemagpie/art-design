	<h1>Places in the Bay Area that Drive the Concept of STEAM</h1>
		
	<p>I know my daughter is her own person. I can still dream of sharing with her a world of augmented realities, of internet of things and of useful smart devices. I want her to be aware of a world that makes use of a part of her mind that can appreciate a particular aesthetic, can map spatial dimensions in her mind, and emphasizes learning by doing. Making and shaping something with your hands can bring a special joy and growth of mind. To that end, I search for communities and activities that nurture her confidence. I look for structures that can give her a scaffold to tackle, yet appreciate, the beautiful, complex realities that make up life and living. </p>

	<p>There are a couple places in the San Francisco Bay Area that I think helps to achieve this. </p>

	<ul>
	<li>Children's Creativity Museum</li>
	<li>CuriOdyssey</li>
	<li>Randall Museum</li>
	<li>Chabot Space and Science Center</li>
	<li>Bay Area Discovery Museum</li>
	<li>Tech Museum of Innovation</li>
	<li>Lawrence Hall of Science</li>
	<li>The Exploratorium</li>
	<li>Local Library programs</li>
	<li>At Home</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>What experiences do you think provides momentum into STEAM for you and your loved ones? </p>

	<h1>A Note from the Avenue Magpie</h1>
	<p>Projects under the Avenue Magpie interpret my experiences of design and culture while living in San Francisco.</p>

	<p>I use the techniques and materials I know of to make my world more meaningful and beautiful. I organize ways to bring my daughter into my projects through complementary, scaled down play. </p>

	<p>My life goal? Pursue balance, harmony and joy through the practice of empathy, creativity and craftsmanship. </p>

	<p>Thanks for reading.</p>
