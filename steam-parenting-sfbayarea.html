	<h1>Places in the Bay Area that Drive the Concept of STEAM</h1>
		
	<p>I know my daughter is her own person. I still aim to share with her what I know of augmented realities, of internet of things and of useful smart devices. She can see this world that will engage her mind to appreciate a particular aesthetic, will help map spatial dimensions to her mind, and emphasizes learning by doing. To make and to shape something with your hands brings a special joy and growth of mind. I keep an eye out for activities to nurture her confidence. I look for structures to give her a scaffold to tackle and appreciate beautiful, complex realities.</p>

	<p>There are a couple places in the San Francisco Bay Area that I think helps to achieve this. </p>

	<ul>
	<li>Children's Creativity Museum</li>
	<li>CuriOdyssey</li>
	<li>Randall Museum</li>
	<li>Chabot Space and Science Center</li>
	<li>Bay Area Discovery Museum</li>
	<li>Tech Museum of Innovation</li>
	<li>Lawrence Hall of Science</li>
	<li>The Exploratorium</li>
	<li>Local Library programs</li>
	<li>At Home</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>What experiences do you think provides momentum into STEAM for you and your loved ones? </p>
